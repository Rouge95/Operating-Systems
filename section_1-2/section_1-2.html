                    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
                </summary>

                <h3>Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</h3>
                <p>Executes Java bytecode, providing platform independence and runtime management. Ensures programs run
                    the same across devices.</p>

                <h3>Just-in-Time (JIT) Compiler</h3>
                <p>Converts bytecode to native machine code at runtime to improve execution speed.</p>

                <h3>Kernel</h3>
                <p>The core of the OS responsible for managing CPU, memory, I/O, and system calls. Acts as the bridge
                    between hardware and software.</p>

                <h3>Layered Approach</h3>
                <p>OS is organized in layers; each layer provides services to the one above and uses services from the
                    layer below. Easier maintenance and debugging.</p>

                <h3>Mach Operating System</h3>
                <p>An OS example using the microkernel approach for modularity and portability.</p>

                <h3>Microkernel Approach</h3>
                <p>Minimal kernel with essential services only. Other services run in user space for better reliability
                    and security.</p>

                <h3>Modular Kernel</h3>
                <p>Kernel supports dynamically loadable modules to extend functionality without rebooting the system.
                </p>

                <h3>Operating-System Structure</h3>
                <p>Defines how the OS components, services, and interfaces are organized.</p>

                <h3>Simulation, Virtual Machine, and Virtualization</h3>
                <p>Techniques to run multiple OS instances or environments on a single physical machine.</p>

                <h3>VMware Architecture</h3>
                <p>An example virtualization platform using hypervisors to host multiple guest OSs.</p>

                    <h2>Operating-System Services</h2>
                </summary>

                <h3>Application Programming Interface (API)</h3>
                <p>Provides routines and protocols for programs to request OS services.</p>

                <h3>Services Helpful to Users</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Command interpreter (shell) – Executes user commands.</li>
                    <li>Communications – Supports networking and messaging.</li>
                    <li>Error detection – Reports hardware or software issues.</li>
                    <li>File-system manipulation – Access, modify, and organize files.</li>
                    <li>Graphical User Interface (GUI) – Provides visual interface for users.</li>
                    <li>I/O operations – Facilitates input/output with devices.</li>
                    <li>Program execution – Loads, runs, and manages user programs.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Services for Efficient System Operation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Accounting – Tracks resource usage.</li>
                    <li>Protection and security – Ensures only authorized access.</li>
                    <li>Resource allocation – Manages CPU, memory, and device usage.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>System Call</h3>
                <p>A controlled mechanism for user programs to request OS services. Switches CPU from user mode to
                    kernel mode to execute privileged operations.</p>

                <h3>System-Call Interface</h3>
                <p>The interface that maps high-level API calls to kernel operations.</p>

                <h3>Systems Programs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Communication programs (e.g., web browsers) – Facilitate network operations.</li>
                    <li>Compilers, interpreters, assemblers, and debuggers – Translate and debug code.</li>
                    <li>File managers and text editors – Provide file operations and editing tools.</li>
                    <li>Logging, registry, system information tools – Help maintain and monitor system state.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Types of System Calls</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Process control – create, terminate, or manage processes.</li>
                    <li>File management – open, read, write, close files.</li>
                    <li>Device management – request I/O operations, allocate devices.</li>
                    <li>Information maintenance – get/set system data, time, or status.</li>
                    <li>Communications – send/receive messages between processes or systems.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h2>Reflection Questions with Answers</h2>
                </summary>

                <h3>Understanding OS Services & System Calls</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Three advantage points:</strong> usability (user-friendly services), efficiency
                        (resource management), portability (hardware abstraction).</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance services:</strong> resource allocation, accounting, protection/security.
                        <strong>Usability services:</strong> GUI, command interpreter, file-system operations, program
                        execution.</li>
                    <li><strong>System calls:</strong> Mechanism for user programs to request kernel services. Works by
                        switching CPU from user mode to kernel mode, executing privileged operations, then returning to
                        user mode.</li>
                    <li><strong>Linux system calls vs C library:</strong> The C library wraps system calls in standard
                        functions, providing a higher-level, portable interface while the actual syscall executes in the
                        kernel.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Kernel Structure Reflection</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Microkernels move services to user space for reliability; layered kernels organize functionality
                        hierarchically; modular kernels allow dynamic extension. Microkernels are smaller but may have
                        performance overhead due to more inter-process communication.</li>
                    <li>Separating kernel and user space protects system stability, prevents accidental or malicious
                        interference, and enforces privilege boundaries.</li>
                    <li>In virtual machines, user-mode programs and guest OS kernel calls are managed by the hypervisor.
                        Privileged instructions are trapped and handled safely to emulate hardware behavior.</li>
                </ul>
